## Course Overview

In this independent study, we will taking a deep dive into the ways that various technological tools can be used to enhance the learning of reading and writing. For the first three weeks, I will provide topics and tools  and readings for you to explore. For the final two weeks (or so), you will create and conduct a final project which will demonstrate what you have learned and how you will put that into practice with your students.

### Week 0 - Setting the table/Diving In

This week will lay the foundation of everything that is to follow.

Here are the basics about this learning experience:

1. **What is an Independent Study?** An independent study is a unique type of educational experience where you can work directly with a professor to investigate and explore something important and interesting to you. In this case, you will be exploring technology tools that support and enhance the teaching of reading and writing.

2. **What's Required**? A 3-credit graduate course is supposed to represent 37.5 hours of work on the part of the student. I expect that you will do so. It is up to you to put in all the required time necessary for the successful completion of this course.

3. **How Will We Work Together?** I will lay out the work for Weeks 1-3, which you will complete thoroughly and completely. As stated above, you will also create, perform, and reflect upon a final project. You will keep track of your work using a **reflective journal** (see below). We can communicate by email and/or schedule Zoom sessions if that would be helpful.

4. **Journal**. Throughout this independent study, I expect that you will keep a detailed and reflective journal that will document what you have done (both things that worked and things that did not work), including screenshots where appropriate; your responses to these experiences (what you learned, along with questions, wonderings, comments, challenges, etc.); and how you might apply these tools or experiences with your students. Please do this using either a Google Doc  or Office 365 doc. If Google, be sure to share it with me at arditog@mville.edu. If Office 365, please share it with me at gerald.ardito@mville.edu. Which shareable document you create, please be sure to give me editing privileges so I can provide feedback.

### Week 1 - Reading Computationally

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/plottingplots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/love-death-rj.png?resize=1024%2C833&ssl=1" alt="screenshot from the PlottingPlots website" style="zoom:67%;" />

This week, you will dive deeply into how we can read texts computationally in order to explore and discover new meanings and connections. For this exploration, we will make great use of a tool/website called [Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com), authored by a former colleague, Dr. Tom Liam Lynch. Tom has done extensive work in introducing and training ELA teachers in the powerful use of these types of computational reading tools. Here's [a recent article](https://plottingplots.com/chatgpt-tells-me-the-pros-and-cons-of-reading-books-with-literary-data/) on the site by Tom on ChatGPT and reading books. 

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Introduction to Plotting Plots.** Read [An English Teacher’s Guide to Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com/an-english-teachers-guide-to-plotting-plots/), which Tom has put together as a introduction to his work This article includes a link to a Reader's Guide, entitled For Book Lovers who Like Data. Please download this guide and work through the exercises you will find there. As you do so, please create a journal so you can reflect on your experiences and also share any questions or wonderings that strike you. 

2. **Watch Some Videos**. Tom has put together this brief, free online video course [Much Ado About K-12 Computer Science]([Much Ado About K-12 Computer Science: A Crash Course for Middle and High School ELA and English Teachers - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_YqVfTEvsGJ8j-5pJiKVPN7bGjMfDvnL)). Watch some (or all) of the videos as you see fit. Once again, use your journal to record your thoughts, learnings, wonderings, and questions.

3. **Play with Plotting Plots**. Now it's time to create some plots for yourself. Go to the section on[Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com) called *Make Some Plots* and have some fun. Pick some texts, ask some questions of it, and share (in your journal), what you have discovered. Make sure to include screenshots of the plots you have created.

4. **Beyond Plotting Plots.** Let's go beyond Plotting Plots. Another great tool for these kinds of computational reading is called [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which I have used extensively in my research. Start with their great [Tutorial]([Tutorial/Workshop - Voyant Tools Help (voyant-tools.org)](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tutorial-section-topics)) and have fun reading texts. And, you guessed it, keep track of your adventures in your journal and be sure to take screenshots. One thing I have done is to upload my own writing or that of my students to see what kinds of trends there are.

5. **Application.** How would you got about applying this approach to computational reading with your students? What texts might you use and in what types of inquiries would you ask your students to engage? Create (in your journal) at least one lesson plan or project that you would be willing to try with your students.

### Week 2 - Tools for Writing

For those of us who teach students to read and/or write, writing tools seem transparent in a way. Just in the background. But I firmly believe that, to paraphrase Churchill, we build our tools and then our tools build us. Writing tools are no exception.

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Reading - The Simple Things You Need to Know as a Data Science Beginner.** Please start this week's work by reading this (to my mind) [interesting and thought provoking article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-simple-things-you-need-to-know-as-a-data-science-beginner-c4b9ffd0b516) from our friends at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). Feel free to **share your reactions** on Slack.

2. **Play/Work with Python and R**. Now that you have set yourself up to write Python and R code, it's time to roll up our sleeves and start coding. Here's what to do:

In the past several months, our news feeds have been clogged with stories about AI writing tools such as ChatGPT. In this week, we will be doing a deep dive into this type of machine assisted writing.

Now that we have done some work to manipulate data in Python and R, we will turn our attention this week to the exploration of data using those two powerful programming languages. 

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Reading - An Extensive Step by Step Guide to Exploratory Data Analysis** Please start this week's work by reading [this very useful and interesting article](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-extensive-guide-to-exploratory-data-analysis-ddd99a03199e)that provides a practical overview of exploratory data analysis from our friends at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/).

### Weeks 4-5 - Final Project



Not that you have spent the first three weeks (or so) of the course exploring technological tools that could enhance the teaching of reading and writing, it's time for you to design, conduct, and report on a final project.

The goal of this project is for you to focus intensively on either one of the areas we have already explored or something else that you would like to play with.
