## Course Overview

In the last few months, are our newsfeeds and attention have been swamped with stories about AI (ChatGPT in particular), it is easy to lose sight of the fact that computer scientists (such as Marvin Minsky) and others have been working on artificial intelligence for decades (see this useful article on artificial intelligence from Wikipedia to get a sense of this rich history). 

It is certainly clear by now that AI enhanced tools will affect how we and our students will learn. That is the focus of this independent study.

For the first three weeks, I will provide topics and tools  and readings for you to explore. For the final two weeks (or so), you will create and conduct a final project which will demonstrate what you have learned and how you will put that into practice with your students.

### Part 0 - Setting the table/Diving In

This week will lay the foundation of everything that is to follow.

Here are the basics about this learning experience:

1. **What is an Independent Study?** An independent study is a unique type of educational experience where you can work directly with a professor to investigate and explore something important and interesting to you. In this case, you will be exploring technology tools that support and enhance the teaching of reading and writing.

2. **What's Required**? A 3-credit graduate course is supposed to represent 37.5 hours of work on the part of the student. I expect that you will do so. It is up to you to put in all the required time necessary for the successful completion of this course.

3. **How Will We Work Together?** I will lay out the work for Weeks 1-3, which you will complete thoroughly and completely. As stated above, you will also create, perform, and reflect upon a final project. You will keep track of your work using a **reflective journal** (see below). We can communicate by email and/or schedule Zoom sessions if that would be helpful.

4. **Journal**. Throughout this independent study, I expect that you will keep a detailed and reflective journal that will document what you have done (both things that worked and things that did not work), including screenshots where appropriate; your responses to these experiences (what you learned, along with questions, wonderings, comments, challenges, etc.); and how you might apply these tools or experiences with your students. Please do this using either a Google Doc  or Office 365 doc. If Google, be sure to share it with me at arditog@mville.edu. If Office 365, please share it with me at gerald.ardito@mville.edu. Which shareable document you create, please be sure to give me editing privileges so I can provide feedback.

### Part 1 - What is AI? How does it work?

*AI Generated text describing this chunk of work:*
As educators, it is essential for teachers to not only be knowledgeable in their subject matter but also stay abreast of the latest technological advancements that impact the education landscape. Understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) works holds immense importance for teachers as it will undoubtedly shape and transform the future of education. By comprehending AI, educators can harness its potential to enhance student learning experiences, personalize education to cater to individual needs, and improve administrative tasks thereby saving time and resources. Furthermore, being well-versed in AI allows teachers to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge required to thrive in an AI-driven world. It enables them to facilitate critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and ethical considerations related to AI technology. By embracing this understanding, educators can effectively prepare students for a future filled with AI advancements while nurturing their curiosity and adaptability skills along the way.

In the last few months, are our newsfeeds and attention have been swamped with stories about AI (ChatGPT in particular), it is easy to lose sight of the fact that computer scientists (such as Marvin Minsky) and others have been working on artificial intelligence for decades. See [this useful article on artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) from Wikipedia to get a sense of this rich history).



For **Part 1**, we will get started by working to understanding how the lastest AI tools, which are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) work. These readings range from highly narrative to highly technical. 

1. **Light, accurate, but fun.** Computer Scientist has Janelle Shane has a blog [AI Weirdness](https://www.aiweirdness.com) in which she asks AI to do fun things (like create Valentine's cards), that also illustrate how AI works and what it can and cannot do.
Pick at least a couple of posts to read.
By the way, I highly recommend her recent book, "[You Look Like a Thing and I Love You](https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing)."

2. **Less dense, but useful.** [This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-chatgpt-works-the-models-behind-the-bot-1ce5fca96286) is from our friends at Towards Data Science (which provided resources for our Data and Education independent study). Note: to read this, you will need to create a free account on [Medium](https://medium.com).


3. **More dense, but really good**. Computer Science Stephen Wolfram has written https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/of how AI models work. 

Please do these readings, then create a journal to record your thoughts, questions, reactions, wonderings, etc. and share it with me. 

### Part 2: AI and Education

*An AI generated description of the topic:*
Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various sectors of society, including education. For graduate students in a course on the effects of AI, it is crucial to understand how this technology can enhance and transform the learning experience. AI enables personalized and adaptive learning, catering to individual student's needs while providing real-time feedback and tracking progress. It also helps automate administrative tasks, allowing educators more time for actual instruction. Furthermore, AI enables data-driven decision making by analyzing vast amounts of information, identifying areas where interventions are needed, and predicting future outcomes. However, concerns such as privacy and ethical considerations arise when implementing AI in education. Therefore, graduate students need to critically examine the potential benefits and challenges associated with AI integration in educational settings to ensure responsible use that optimizes learning outcomes while minimizing any negative impact on students' well-being or intellectual growth.

In the past several months, our news feeds have been clogged with stories about AI writing tools such as ChatGPT. In this week, we will be doing a deep dive into this type of machine assisted writing.

Now that we have been reading about AI tools and how these might/will affect teaching and learning, it's time for a deep dive into AI writing tools, as well as other generative AI tools.

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Writing with AI tools/ChatGPT**. Here is some work that will allow you to first explore some AI writing tools and then to take a deep dive into using AI tools to perform searches, create documents, design activities for your students, and more. As you do this work, be sure to document your learning and substantively reflect on what you have done and seen and thought in your journal.

   | Chunks                                                 | Assignment                                                   |
   | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Chunk 1: Working with AI Tools.**                    | The goal of this junk is to wade into the water of AI tools to do the kinds of writing things that we do: perform searches, create documents, explore what make ChatGPT prompts more and more useful. [Here are some resources](https://github.com/drardito/EnglishEdTech/blob/main/AI%20and%20Writing.md) to get you started, but there is no need to be limited by them. |
   | **Chunk 2: Diving Deeply into Working with AI Tools.** | Now that you have done some wading, it is time to dive more deeply into writing with these AI tools. Try out some more substantive writing, such as a long form research paper with citations and work to craft some assignments for your students (along with samples) that you could use in your classroom. You can also include some generate AI images, video, and/or music with your writing. |

   


### Part 4 - Final Project

Now that you have been immersed in the world of AI and Education, it is time for you to focus deeply on a topic/tool that has/might/will affect your teaching and your students.

This final project could be:

1. **Research.** You can design and conduct a research project that allows you to discover and synthesize research and other writings about how A will affect K-12 teaching (especially the teaching of computer science). OR
2. **AI Tool Exploration**. You could identify, explore, and report on AI tools that you might want to use with your students and how you might use them. In addition to reporting on what tools you investigated and discussing how you might incorporate them into your teaching, please include examples of learning activities of your own design.
3. **Build Your Own AI Assistant.** Here are the instructions for creating your own AI assistant using Python:
   https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-ai-personal-assistant-using-python-f57247b4494b
4. **Build Your Own Adventure**. This is a build your own adventure that marries AI and Education. 



#### All of this work is due no later than Friday August 4.
