## Course Overview

In this independent study, we will taking a deep dive into the ways that various technological tools can be used to enhance the learning of reading and writing. For the first three weeks, I will provide topics and tools  and readings for you to explore. For the final two weeks (or so), you will create and conduct a final project which will demonstrate what you have learned and how you will put that into practice with your students.

### Week 0 - Setting the table/Diving In

This week will lay the foundation of everything that is to follow.

Here are the basics about this learning experience:

1. **What is an Independent Study?** An independent study is a unique type of educational experience where you can work directly with a professor to investigate and explore something important and interesting to you. In this case, you will be exploring technology tools that support and enhance the teaching of reading and writing.

2. **What's Required**? A 3-credit graduate course is supposed to represent 37.5 hours of work on the part of the student. I expect that you will do so. It is up to you to put in all the required time necessary for the successful completion of this course.

3. **How Will We Work Together?** I will lay out the work for Weeks 1-3, which you will complete thoroughly and completely. As stated above, you will also create, perform, and reflect upon a final project. You will keep track of your work using a **reflective journal** (see below). We can communicate by email and/or schedule Zoom sessions if that would be helpful.

4. **Journal**. Throughout this independent study, I expect that you will keep a detailed and reflective journal that will document what you have done (both things that worked and things that did not work), including screenshots where appropriate; your responses to these experiences (what you learned, along with questions, wonderings, comments, challenges, etc.); and how you might apply these tools or experiences with your students. Please do this using either a Google Doc  or Office 365 doc. If Google, be sure to share it with me at arditog@mville.edu. If Office 365, please share it with me at gerald.ardito@mville.edu. Which shareable document you create, please be sure to give me editing privileges so I can provide feedback.

### Week 1 - Reading Computationally

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/plottingplots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/love-death-rj.png?resize=1024%2C833&ssl=1" alt="screenshot from the PlottingPlots website" style="zoom:67%;" />

This week, you will dive deeply into how we can read texts computationally in order to explore and discover new meanings and connections. For this exploration, we will make great use of a tool/website called [Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com), authored by a former colleague, Dr. Tom Liam Lynch. Tom has done extensive work in introducing and training ELA teachers in the powerful use of these types of computational reading tools. 

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Introduction to Plotting Plots.** Read [An English Teacherâ€™s Guide to Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com/an-english-teachers-guide-to-plotting-plots/), which Tom has put together as a introduction to his work This article includes a link to a Reader's Guide, entitled For Book Lovers who Like Data. Please download this guide and work through the exercises you will find there. As you do so, please create a journal so you can reflect on your experiences and also share any questions or wonderings that strike you. 

2. **Watch Some Videos**. Tom has put together this brief, free online video course [Much Ado About K-12 Computer Science]([Much Ado About K-12 Computer Science: A Crash Course for Middle and High School ELA and English Teachers - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_YqVfTEvsGJ8j-5pJiKVPN7bGjMfDvnL)). Watch some (or all) of the videos as you see fit. Once again, use your journal to record your thoughts, learnings, wonderings, and questions.

3. **Play with Plotting Plots**. Now it's time to create some plots for yourself. Go to the section on[Plotting Plots](https://plottingplots.com) called *Make Some Plots* and have some fun. Pick some texts, ask some questions of it, and share (in your journal), what you have discovered. Make sure to include screenshots of the plots you have created.

4. **Beyond Plotting Plots.** Let's go beyond Plotting Plots. Another great tool for these kinds of computational reading is called [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which I have used extensively in my research. Start with their great [Tutorial]([Tutorial/Workshop - Voyant Tools Help (voyant-tools.org)](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tutorial-section-topics)) and have fun reading texts. And, you guessed it, keep track of your adventures in your journal and be sure to take screenshots. One thing I have done is to upload my own writing or that of my students to see what kinds of trends there are.

5. **Application.** How would you got about applying this approach to computational reading with your students? What texts might you use and in what types of inquiries would you ask your students to engage? Create (in your journal) at least one lesson plan or project that you would be willing to try with your students.

### Week 2 - Tools for Writing

For those of us who teach students to read and/or write, writing tools seem transparent in a way. Just in the background. But I firmly believe that, to paraphrase Churchill, we build our tools and then our tools build us. Writing tools are no exception. You are probably most familiar with working in Office 365 and/or Google Docs. This week, you will add [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to your repetoire.



Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Reading - Educational technology: what it is and how it works.** Please start this week's work by reading this (to my mind) [interesting and thought provoking article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QbwQrYAnRyQfKTGdrTLoa8xrsELqwXy5/view?usp=drive_link) from [Jon Dron](https://jondron.ca), who has a great deal of expertise in learning technologies. This article (and Jon's work in general) has shaped much of how I think about learning technologies. Please read the article and create a substantive reflection in your journal.

2. **Play/Work with Markdown**. Markdown is a lightweight markup language (meaning a coding language), which means that it contains both text and instruction for how this text should be rendered. It has all kinds of cool features and these documents can easily be shared in ways that they look beautiful. This webpage was written entirely using Markdown.

   | Chunks                                                       | Assignments                                                  |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Chunk 1: [Working with Markdown](https://github.com/drardito/EnglishEdTech/blob/main/Working%20with%20Markdown.md)** | Please work through getting yourself set up with StackEdit and Markdown. Please work through the ideas and resources in [this document](https://github.com/drardito/EnglishEdTech/blob/main/Working%20with%20Markdown.md), and then share what you learn and do via your journal, as well as sharing your StackEdit document with me. |
   | **Chunk 2: Create one or more resources for your students using Markdown** | Once you feel like you have a handle on working fluidly with Markdown in StackEdit, I ask that you create one or more documents using these tools that you would use with your students. Really push beyond your comfort zone to create beautiful and useful multimedia resources for your students. |




### Week 3 - Machine (AI) Writing

In the past several months, our news feeds have been clogged with stories about AI writing tools such as ChatGPT. In this week, we will be doing a deep dive into this type of machine assisted writing.

Now that we have done some work using Markdown, we will turn our attention this week to the writing with AI tools.

Here is what you will do this week:

1. **Reading - Chat GPT**. Here's [a recent article](https://plottingplots.com/chatgpt-tells-me-the-pros-and-cons-of-reading-books-with-literary-data/) on the site by Tom Liam Lynch on ChatGPT and reading books. Please read it and then create a substantive reflection in your journal.

2. **Reading - [Writing As Academic Practice In An Time Of Generative AI](https://helenbeetham.substack.com/p/writing-as-academic-practice-in-an).** Please read this transcript from an interesting (at least to me) recent conference presentation, then create a substantive reflection in your journal.

3. **Writing with AI tools/ChatGPT**. Here is some work that will allow you to first explore some AI writing tools and then to take a deep dive into using AI tools to perform searches, create documents, design activities for your students, and more. As you do this work, be sure to document your learning and substantively reflect on what you have done and seen and thought in your journal.

   | Chunks                                                 | Assignment                                                   |
   | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Chunk 1: Working with AI Tools.**                    | The goal of this junk is to wade into the water of AI tools to do the kinds of writing things that we do: perform searches, create documents, explore what make ChatGPT prompts more and more useful. [Here are some resources](https://github.com/drardito/EnglishEdTech/blob/main/AI%20and%20Writing.md) to get you started, but there is no need to be limited by them. |
   | **Chunk 2: Diving Deeply into Working with AI Tools.** | Now that you have done some wading, it is time to dive more deeply into writing with these AI tools. Try out some more substantive writing, such as a long form research paper with citations and work to craft some assignments for your students (along with samples) that you could use in your classroom. |

   

### Weeks 4-5 - Final Project



Not that you have spent the first three weeks (or so) of the course exploring technological tools that could enhance the teaching of reading and writing, it's time for you to design, conduct, and report on a final project.

The goal of this project is for you to focus intensively on either one of the areas we have already explored or something else that you would like to play with.
